# Using Architecture Deecision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The tacboard-project is  growing and I need to make a lot of decisions. So far, I have been able to remember most my decision in my head,
but as the project progresses more and more time elapses and I won't be able to remember all the decisions and why I made them in a 
particular way.

Also, for other readers of the code there is no way to understand why things are done in a certain way. Oftentimes  there is more than one
plausible way to do things (and sometimes I opt to ignore the cleanest solution in favor of building new features).

I want to document these decisions for my future self and other readers of the code.

## Decision

Relevant architectural decisions should be documented in an a decision record like this one.

## Consequences

Whenever a significant decision is made, I will take some time to summarize the decision as long as the options that were considered and
describe the context of the decision.
